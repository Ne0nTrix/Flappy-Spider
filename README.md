# Flappy Spider

First project using Java for university. <br>
Everything was made by one person. <br>
Aseprite for 2D art and used IntelliJ IDEA to write in Java. <br>
It's a game inspired by Flappy Bird.

A spider is going around left and right while the player has to jump at a good moment to catch a fly and avoid toxic rain. <br>
There is no specific end goal, only getting as much points as possible. <br>
Though it's fun for friends to compete in and doesn't consume too much time (My friends approve).

It leaves room for many features to be implemented, like adding some upgrades or making different obstacles.
